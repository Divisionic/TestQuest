#m You spot a lonely girl, seemingly not older the 19 Years, sit beneath a bus stop. Her clothes are dirty, she has very pale, nearly grey skin, and her stench is comparable to rotten... Garlic? Onions? Her head hangs low, at closer inspection you notice she misses an eye, but that doesn't mind her.
#m Young girl|"..."

    js_intro|"... Hello?"

#m "..." You feel a bit creeped out by her, and decide to go away. She doesn't say anything, nor are you sure if she even noticed you at all.
#exit
*js_intro
#m She slowly looks up, and you can see her facial details better now. She is clearly missing an eye, is extremely pale, and has nearly milkwhite Eyes.
#m Young girl|"... Hm?"

    js_talk1|"Are you... Ok?"
    js_dull1|"Jesus christ what the fuck happened to you!?"
    js_leave1|Leave
*js_talk1
#m As softly as you can, you ask "Are you... Ok?"
#m Young Girl|"... Yeah." she answers, dull. You expect a feminine pitch, yet it sounded deep, as if she hasn't used her voice in decades.

*js_dull1
#m "Jesus christ what the fuck happened to you!?"
#m Young girl|"..." she doesn't answer, and just continues to stare at you. You feel a sense of unease, and have a feeling this wasn't the way to go.

#m "...I...uhm..." You feel creeped out by her, and decide to leave. You look back at her, but she already has returned to the position you found her in.
