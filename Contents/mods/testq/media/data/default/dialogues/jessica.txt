#m You spot a lonely girl, seemingly not older the 19 Years, sit beneath a bus stop. Her clothes are dirty, she has very pale, nearly grey skin, and her stench is comparable to rotten... Garlic? Onions? Her head hangs low, at closer inspection you notice she misses an eye, but that doesn't mind her.
#m Young girl|"..."

    js_intro|"... Hello?"
    js_leave1|Leave
*js_leave1
#m "..." You feel a bit creeped out by her, and decide to go away. She doesn't say anything, nor are you sure if she even noticed you at all.
#exit
*js_intro
#m She slowly looks up, and you can see her facial details better now. She is clearly missing an eye, is extremely pale, and has nearly milkwhite Eyes.
#m Young girl|"... Hm?"

    js_talk1|"Are you... Ok?"
    js_dull1|"Jesus christ what the fuck happened to you!?"
    js_leave1|Leave
*js_dull1
#m "Jesus christ what the fuck happened to you!?"
#m Young girl|"..." she doesn't answer, and just continues to stare at you. You feel a sense of unease, and have a feeling this wasn't the way to go.

*js_leave2
#m "...I...uhm..." You feel creeped out by her, and decide to leave. You look back at her, but she already has returned to the position you found her in.
#exit
*js_talk1
#m As softly as you can, you ask "Are you... Ok?"
#m Young Girl|"... Yeah." she answers, dull. You expect a feminine pitch, yet it sounded deep, as if she hasn't used her voice in decades.

    js_question1|"Who are you?"
    js_question2|"What are you doing here?"
    js_leave3|"I'll... Gotta go."
*js_leave3
#m "I... Gotta go." As you leave her alone, she looks after you for a few seconds, before resting her head in the same position again when you first found her.
#exit
*js_question2
#m "What are you doing here?"
#m Young girl|"... I'm waiting...for the bus to arrive." she says, each word sounding a little bit higher then the last one, as if she tries to get her old pitch again.
#m Confused, you ask "You uh... How long have you been waiting for?"
#m Young girl|"... Soon." She looks at her wristwatch, but you notice it's broken. then points at the torn piece of paper on the wall, and says "My Bus should arrive... Soon..."
#choice
    js_question1|"Who are you?"
    js_question3|"I... You do know that Busses don't exist anymore?"
    js_question4|"What's a bus?"
    js_leave3|"I... Gotta go."
*js_question4
#m Confused, you ask "What's a bus?"
#m Young girl|"..." She doesn't say anything, but instead squints her eyes slightly as if she was confused by your question. Finally, she says "I... I'm just waiting for my bus..."

#m "I... You do know that busses don't exist anymore?"
#m Young girl|"What... Are you talking... about?" She squints her eyes, very confused by what you said. "It... It'll come... Soon..."
