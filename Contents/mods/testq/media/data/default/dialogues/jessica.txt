#m You spot a lonely girl, seemingly not older the 19 Years, sit beneath a bus stop. Her clothes are dirty, she has very pale, nearly grey skin, and her stench is comparable to rotten... Garlic? Onions? Her head hangs low, at closer inspection you notice she misses an eye, but that doesn't mind her.

#m Young girl|Jessica.png|"... I'm waiting...for the bus to arrive." she says, each word sounding a little bit higher then the last one, as if she tries to get her old pitch again.
#m Confused, you ask "You uh... How long have you been waiting for?"
#m Young girl|Jessica.png|"... Soon." She looks at her wristwatch, but you notice it's broken. then points at the torn piece of paper on the wall, and says "My Bus should arrive... Soon..."
