#entry This old Man near the Table
    #line pa_intro|Found Patrick in an old Military Base deep in the woods. He told me he was still waiting for his orders after 20 years... Quite the odd fellow, especially after he denies that the Military doesn't exist anymore. He rambles something about a pod, though I don't know what that means. I should talk to him soon again.
    #line pa_q1_completed|His leg was in severe pain, so I gave him some painkillers from the tent, just to help this old man... That eleviated some of his pain and brought him Peace, enough to put him to sleep. I don't think I can talk to him again...

    #line js_intro|I found Jessica beneath a Bus stop, near a Prison. She's waiting for a Bus to take her home, but I doubt it'll ever arrive.
    #line js_q1_completed|As soon as I gave Jessica the Chips bag, she sacked in on herself. I... I don't know why, but I had a feeling of relief. I'm not sure if she's alive, hell, if she was ever alive at all, but now she seems at peace. I hope atleast.
