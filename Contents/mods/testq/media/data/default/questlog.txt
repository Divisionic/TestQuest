#entry This old Man near the Table
    #line pa_intro|Found Patrick in an old Military Base deep in the woods. He told me he was still waiting for his orders after 20 years... Quite the odd fellow, especially after he denies that the Military doesn't exist anymore. He rambles something about a pod, though I don't know what that means. I should talk to him soon again.
    #line pa_q1_cleared|His leg was in severe pain, so I gave him some painkillers from the tent, just to help this old man... That eleviated some of his pain and brought him Peace, enough to put him to sleep. I don't think I can talk to him again...
